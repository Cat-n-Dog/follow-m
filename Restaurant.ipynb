The object is to predict annual restaurant sales based on objective measurements.\n\nThis is an interesting problem to me because it's set up in a classic regression setting. So all classic regression techniques should be applicable to the problem. The trick though, as like all machine learning problem, is to carefully test the various models and select the most generalizable one."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Competition Description"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "With over 1,200 quick service restaurants across the globe, TFI is the company behind some of the world's most well-known brands: Burger King, Sbarro, Popeyes, Usta Donerci, and Arby\u2019s. They employ over 20,000 people in Europe and Asia and make significant daily investments in developing new restaurant sites.\n\nRight now, deciding when and where to open new restaurants is largely a subjective process based on the personal judgement and experience of development teams. This subjective data is difficult to accurately extrapolate across geographies and cultures. \n\nNew restaurant sites take large investments of time and capital to get up and running. When the wrong location for a restaurant brand is chosen, the site closes within 18 months and operating losses are incurred. \n\nFinding a mathematical model to increase the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites would allow TFI to invest more in other important business areas, like sustainability, innovation, and training for new employees. Using demographic, real estate, and commercial data, this competition challenges you to predict the annual restaurant sales of 100,000 regional locations."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#Data Exploration"}, {"metadata": {"trusted": true, "collapsed": true}, "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# todo", "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#First cut, linear regression"}, {"metadata": {"trusted": true, "collapsed": true}, "execution_count": null, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# todo", "outputs": []}], "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 0, "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"language": "python", "display_name": "Python 2", "name": "python2"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 2}, "file_extension": ".py", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython2", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "version": "2.7.6"}}}
