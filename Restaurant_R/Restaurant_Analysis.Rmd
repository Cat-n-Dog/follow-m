This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#library(checkpoint)
# checkpoint(snapshotDate = '2015-03-25')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library('lubridate')
library('dplyr')
library('glmnet')
```

```{r}
train_df <- read.csv(file = 'train.csv')
```

Open.Date is parsed as factors, which might not be what we exactly are looking after.

```{r}
train_df$Open.Date <- lubridate::mdy(train_df$Open.Date)
```

```{r}
# mdl <- lm(formula = revenue ~ . - Id - Open.Date - City.Group - Type, data = train_df)
# summary(mdl)
# sqrt( mean( residuals(mdl) ^ 2 ) )
```

```{r}
train_df <- train_df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Open.Year = year(Open.Date), Open.Month = month(Open.Date),
                City2 = ifelse(test = City.Group == 'Big Cities', yes = as.character(City), no = 0))
train_df$City2 <- as.factor(train_df$City2)
train_df$Open.Year <- as.factor(train_df$Open.Year)
train_df$Open.Month <- as.factor(train_df$Open.Month)
#train_df %>% group_by(City.Group) %>% summarise(count = n())
train_tbl_df <- tbl_df(train_df)
train_tbl_df <- train_tbl_df %>%
  filter(Id != 16)
```

```{r}
train_tbl_df_mdl <- train_tbl_df %>% dplyr::select(Id, Open.Year, City2, revenue)
mdl <- lm(formula = revenue ~ . - Id - Open.Year, data = train_tbl_df_mdl)
summary(mdl)
residuals(mdl) %>%
  hist(breaks = 25)
sqrt( mean( residuals(mdl) ^ 2 ) )
```

```{r}
glmnet(x = select(train_df, P1:Open.Year, City2)), y = train_df$revenue)
```


```{r}
test_df <- read.csv(file = 'test.csv')
test_df$Open.Date <- lubridate::mdy(test_df$Open.Date)
test_df <- test_df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Open.Year = year(Open.Date), Open.Month = month(Open.Date),
                City2 = ifelse(test = City.Group == 'Big Cities', yes = as.character(City), no = 0))
test_df$City2 <- as.factor(test_df$City2)
test_df$Open.Year <- as.factor(test_df$Open.Year)
test_df$Open.Month <- as.factor(test_df$Open.Month)
#train_df %>% group_by(City.Group) %>% summarise(count = n())
test_tbl_df <- tbl_df(test_df)

test_tbl_df_pred <- test_tbl_df %>% dplyr::select(Id, P1:Open.Year, City2)
```

In the test set there are Open.year = 1995, 2001, 2003 that weren't included in
training set.
```{r}
factor_change <- function(f) {
  if (f == '1995') {
    return(factor('1996'))
  }
  if (f == '2001') {
    return(factor('2002'))
  }
  if (f == '2003') {
    return(factor('2004'))
  }
}

good <- test_tbl_df_pred %>%
  dplyr::filter(!Open.Year %in% c(1995, 2001, 2003))
# good$Open.Year <- as.integer(good$Open.Year)
miss <- test_tbl_df_pred %>%
  dplyr::filter(Open.Year %in% c(1995, 2001, 2003))
miss$Open.Year <- sapply(miss$Open.Year, FUN = factor_change)
test_tbl_df_pred_year_fixed <- rbind(good, miss)
# test_tbl_df_pred_year_fixed$Open.Year <- as.factor(test_tbl_df_pred_year_fixed$Open.Year)
```


```{r}
pred <- predict.lm(mdl, newdata = test_tbl_df_pred_year_fixed)
submission <- data.frame(Id = 0:99999, Prediction=pred)
write.csv(submission, file='submission.csv', row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
```
